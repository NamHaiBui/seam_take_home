# seam_take_home Project

This README outlines how to run the seam_take_home application.

## Prerequisites

**For both Docker and npm methods:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.  See https://nodejs.org/  

**For Docker method:**

* Docker installed and running. See https://www.docker.com/get-started 

## Running the Application

### 1. Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t seam_take_home .
   ```

2. **Run the Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> seam_take_home
   ```
   * Replace `<host_port>` with the port you want to access the application on your local machine (e.g., 3000).
   * Replace `<container_port>`  with the port the application listens on within the container (consult the project code).

3. **Access the application:**  Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:<host_port>`

### 2. Using `npm run dev`

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev 
   ```
   * This typically starts a server (e.g.,  http://localhost:5173) â€“ check your project's scripts for the specific URL.

3. **Access the application:**  Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the development server is running.

## Additional Notes

* **Environment Variables:** If the project requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project root.  See related documentation for format and usage.
* **Production Deployment:** For production environments, consult project documentation on building optimized bundles and recommended deployment methods.
